############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

## "Oczko" would be that jack is 2, queen is 3 and king is 4 and ace is always 11
## cards = [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
## Alternative "Oczko" is from 9 to ace and 9 is worth 0
## cards = [2, 3, 4, 0, 10, 11]
